# mDTLZ1-mDTLZ4-Test-Problems
mDTLZ1-mDTLZ4 are four scalable multiobjective optimization test problems proposed in the paper 
"On Scalable Multiobjective Test Problems with Hardly Dominated Boundaries". 
Here are the Matlab codes of the test problems along with their corresponding theoretical Pareto fronts.
